My name's Daniel and I'm trying to learn how to juggle with PHP.\r\nThe PHP language must not be treated as an easy-to-learn language, if you do so, you'll miss out everything. Try to concentrate as much as you can on the smaller details and don't miss anything because that comma you forgot to add ruins it all. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI'm Daniel, My GitHub username  is @completit.
